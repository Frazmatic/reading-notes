## Introduction

My pronouns are he/him, and you can call me Josh.

I have about ten years of IT experience. I served eight years active duty in the USAF, where I worked positions such as Network Manager, IT Project Manager, Digital Systems Technician, and intelligence unit maintainer. After getting out, I worked for a year at the Port of Seattle as an Infrastructure Operations Technician, which included System Administrator duties, network monitoring & security, and general IT maintenance. 

Throughout my career, I have gained some light experience in coding. I've written Bash & Python scripts to automate tasks, analyze data, and improve user experiences. I've helped debug code in C for old Unix mainframes, and occasionally fixed, improved, or created SQL queries.

I have a broad array of experience and education. I am a medically retired (disabled) veteran. I have lived across the US, and in Korea, Japan, Qatar, Greece, and the UK. My family is hispanic and mixed race (Latino/Asian/White). I have an AAS with a **Social Sciences** focus; an Information Systems, **Software Development** Track, AAS; certificates in Python programming; and professional management training. I have performed jobs from phone technical support to liaising with the heads of lettered federal agencies. I believe this diverse set of *social*, *technical*, and *multicultural* lenses give me an advantage in problem identification and solution finding.

## What is a Growth Mindset?

If a person has a growth mindset, they maintain a set of attitudes which emphasize the ability to develop talents and abilities through perseverance and systematic effort. This mindset views challenges, obstacles, and failures as opportunities. By taking a confident, positive, approach when encountering a challenge, rather than avoiding it, a person is more likely to actually find a path to success. By contrast, a person with a fixed mindset would think they intrinsically canâ€™t do it, and never give themselves a chance to succeed. 

## Reminders for Maintaining A Growth Mindset

1. Everyone is at a different point in their learning journey.
2. That thing which seems like a huge nuisance today will be a satisfying accomplishment tomorrow.
3. Things which are easy for you to do now once seemed overwhelming.
