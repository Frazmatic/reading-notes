## Introduction

My pronouns are he/him, and you can call me Josh.

I have about ten years of IT experience. I served eight years active duty in the USAF, where I worked positions such as Network Manager, IT Project Manager, Digital Systems Technician, and intelligence unit maintainer. After getting out, I worked for a year at the Port of Seattle as an Infrastructure Operations Technician, which included System Administrator duties, network monitoring & security, and general IT maintenance. 

Throughout my career, I have gained some light experience in coding. I've written Bash & Python scripts to automate tasks, analyze data, and improve user experiences. I've helped debug code in C for old Unix mainframes, and occasionally fixed, improved, or created SQL queries.

I have a broad array of experience and education. I am a medically retired (disabled) veteran. I have lived across the US, and in Korea, Japan, Qatar, Greece, and the UK. My family is hispanic and mixed race (Latino/Asian/White). I have an AAS with a **Social Sciences** focus; an Information Systems, **Software Development** Track, AAS; certificates in Python programming; and professional management training. I have performed jobs from phone technical support to liaising with the heads of lettered federal agencies. I believe this diverse set of *social*, *technical*, and *multicultural* lenses give me an advantage in problem identification and solution finding.
