## Text Editors

A text editor is an application for writing text, as the name implies. When programming, it can be helpful to use an editor specifically designed for writing code. They include features such as highlighting syntax, code completion, spotting some formatting errors (before compiling or attempting to run the code), and installing extensions. These features can make it easier to read and write your code.

Syntax highlighting does things like highlighting keywords, variables, and operators in different colors so that you can see the “structure” of your code at a glance. Code completion lets the editor “fill in” the rest of the letters for things like keywords and already defined function names; quite handy for those tip-of-tongue moments and simply avoiding typos. Editors can alert you to some common formatting errors without needing to compile or run the program; for example, failing to include a closing bracket or terminating a statement with a semicolon. It’s like a spellcheck for software development. Extensions are additional features which can be installed in the editor; such as previews of HTML documents. 

PCs often come with barebones editors such as notepad; but these don’t include coding specific features. Lightweight editors such as IDLE, Nano, and Atom include additional features such as syntax highlighting; however, their primary function is till just editing text and managing text files. Full IDEs (Integrated Developer Environments) include a suite of programming related functions. They’ll often integrate compiles, debuggers, collaborations features, the ability to generate significant amounts of boilerplate code for you, and other advanced features. The downside is that it may take a while just to learn the IDE itself. 

## The Command Line

When interfacing with a computer without using a graphical interface, you’ll generally be typing text commands in a terminal of some sort. On Windows systems, you can use the *Command Prompt* or *Powershell*. On Linux terminals, a “shell” interprets commands. There are several types, such as bash ( Bourne-Again Shell), ksh (Korn Shell), and zsh (Z Shell). These will differ somewhat in the specific commands used.
