## Markdown

Markdown is a system for formatting text. By adding symbols to the text file, a browser or other markdown reader can format the page. For example, by adding \* before and after a piece of text, *like so*, you can show emphasis. Adding \*\* will make it appear **in bold**, and adding \*\*\* will ***do both***.

Use backticks \(\`\) to mark a block of code, for example: 

`print("hellow world")`

Paragraphs are separated simply by leaving a blank line between them. Tabs should not be used, because they me used as syntax for formatting within the document.

Markdown is a fairly simple and lightweight method of formatting text. It gives a wide variety of formatting options, that can be manually written in even the simplest notepad style text editor. In contexts where a sophisticated word program with a graphical user interface are not available, such as editing a file from the command line, it's a great way to include some formatting. Even when a full fledged editor is available, markdown is a good system for visually formatting files without worrying about compatibility.

Github uses markdown for formatting.
