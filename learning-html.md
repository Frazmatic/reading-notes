## Wireframes

*Wireframing* is essentially creating a diagram that describes the basic layout of a website. Generally, some sort of diagramming tool is used. It can also be done with pen & paper or a whiteboard. Paper prototypes are a common method because they are easily changed. It is a good way to describe the general information layout of the potential site and assess its interface. A good wireframe design is informed by use cases and user flow, and prototypes can be used to test out interaction.

## HTML

*HTML* is a markup language for web documents. It is used to provide structure based on the "meaning", or semantics, of your website's contents. Various HTML tags show what *type* of content is stores within them. For example, the **ul** tags delineate a an unordered list with opening and closing tags. Each one of these sections marked by opening and closing tags is called an "element".

Elements can have attributes. Attributes assign a particular value for that element. A link element has an 'href' (Hypertext REFerence) attribute which stores the URL that the link points to. An image element has an src (source) attribute which has the file location of the image being displayed. Class and ID elements can be assigned for later use in formatting or logic. 

Semantics describe the meaning of something. HTML is meant to be used for semantic markup, describing the "meaning" of the data in the page. HTML can be used for formatting, but it is considered to best practice to use CSS for formatting, and stick to using HTML for semantics. There are about 100 semantic elements available in HTML, such as **header**, **footer**, **article**, **nav**, **main**, and **summary**.
