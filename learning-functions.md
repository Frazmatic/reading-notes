## Functions and Control Flow

The flow of code (order of execution) can be controlled using conditional statements, loops, and functions.

Functions allow for named, reusable, blocks of code that can accept inputs and produce an output. In the function definition, input variables are called parameters. In the function call, the (actual) input values are called arguments. The return keyword is used to exit the function and return a value (of any type).

Not all functions necessarily need to accept arguments or return a value. They may just need to do the same thing every time.

Event driving programming is a paradigm in which "events" control flow.  Under the hood there is probably a loop processing some sort queue, but the programmer may only need to write handling for the triggered events.

A programmer must keep in mind how control structers affect the actual execution of the code.
