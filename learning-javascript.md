## Javascript

Javascript is a programming language, supported by most web browsers, that allows one to include programitic functionality within a website. It is also supported in non-browser environments for a variet of purposes, making it a general purpose programming language. 

DOM (Document Object Model) is a way to access various parts of an HTML document with a Javascript program. For example, the get document.getElementById() method can be used to access an HTML element with the given ID attribute. Javascript can also be written inilne, within the `<script>` tags in an HTML file.

Variables in a programming language allow one to refer to a stored value for use within the program. For example, if I have a varible named 'max', `max = 4;` would store the number 4 in that variable. Later, I could compare other variables to max, perhaps to ensure a count remains less than max. I could also change the value stored in max, perhaps reflecting a change in conditions or requirements. A variable's identifier is essentially a human readable lable for an address in memory. Const, let, and var are keywords used to declare variables in JS. Var is deprecated, but necessary for legacy browser support.

Computers take in information, process it (perform calculations using logic gates) then produce output.
