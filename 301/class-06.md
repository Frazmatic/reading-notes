## Significance

Node is a widely used tool for building JavaScript applications in a variety of environments for many different purposes.

Pair programming is a useful technique for both learning and producing higher quality code.

## Things I want to know more about

I'd like to know how to actually deploy apps written with node.

I'd like to experience actual in person pair programming with an experienced developer.

## Questions:

### [An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

1. What is node.js?

  A JavaScript runtime used for things like server side JavaScript programming.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine?

18.4.0

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

8.12.1

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called jshint?

`npm install -g jshint` installs it globally.

8. What is node used for?

Server programming, stand alone apps, scripting, tools, pretty much anything where you need JavaScript to run outside the browser.

### [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
    1. Greater efficiency
    2. Engaged colloboration
    3. Learning from fellow students
    4. Social skills
    5. Job interview readiness
    6. Work environment readiness

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

4 & 5. I've found the process of explaining my reasoning, or having someone's reasoning explained to me, to be highly beneficial to my own understanding.

3. How does pair programming work?

A driver and a navigator ideally work on the same workstation. The driver does the actual writing (implementation), the navigator does the reasoning and instruction. The navigator can also double check for errors, and research things.
