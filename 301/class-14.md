[That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

PCs became much common in homes. Marketing, media, and other social phenomena may have created a cultural context that, combined with the human tendency to internalize social norms, may have had an adverse affect on women's participation in the field.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

It associated the use of computers with gender norms, creating a social cost (a form of barrier to entry) for women entering the field.

I must say, the type of professors who would say "You should know that by now" still exist in large numbers, reinforcing social stratification and opportunity gaps with their lack of consideration of differences in backgrounds. 

This appears to have happened with computer science in the 80s; university became more filtrational than educational, becoming the gate rather than the key.

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

The article states that diversity efforts are most successful when driven by the leadership, but they are systemic problems as well. Small biases and social structures can accumulate into self-reinforcing, emergent, effects, that increase homogeneity and stratifification. 

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

The heart of innovation is breadth of knowledge and experience. A broader range of perspectives can identify a wider range of solutions. Diverse systems are more robust to change. A diverse company is more adaptable and creative. If everyone thinks similarly you're going to get similar ideas.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

Sometimes a problem can be very obvious to someone from a different background. A company lacking women customers may be overlooking an issue that would be very obvious to women employees.

People from different cultural backgrounds, with different prioritizations and values, may approach a problem from a different angle, or even define the problem differently.

People of diverse backgrounds can often spot those systemic and process related issues that others may miss because they take them for granted, or "can't see the forest for the trees", due to being habituated to those conditions.
