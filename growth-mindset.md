## What is a Growth Mindset?

If a person has a growth mindset, they maintain a set of attitudes which emphasize the ability to develop talents and abilities through perseverance and systematic effort. This mindset views challenges, obstacles, and failures as opportunities. By taking a confident, positive, approach when encountering a challenge, rather than avoiding it, a person is more likely to actually find a path to success. By contrast, a person with a fixed mindset would think they intrinsically canâ€™t do it, and never give themselves a chance to succeed.

## Reminders for Maintaining A Growth Mindset

1. Everyone is at a different point in their learning journey.
2. That thing which seems like a huge nuisance today will be a satisfying accomplishment tomorrow.
3. Things which are easy for you to do now once seemed overwhelming.
