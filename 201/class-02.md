### Ch 2 of Javascript & JQuery: "Basic Javascript Instructions"

A statement is an individual instruction in a script / program. Each one should start on a new line an they are ended with semicolons. Curly braces can be used to delineate code blocks.

Coments can be added to code with /* */ or //.

A variable stores a value. It is essentially a label for a location in memory. A variable is assigned a value with the equal sign (called the assignment operator in this context).

JS has numeric, string, and boolean data types.

Expressions evaluate into a single value.

Operators "operate" on literals or variables to create an expression.

### Ch 4 of Javascript & JQuery: "Decisions and Loops" (pp. 145 - 162)

Decicision making allows for flow control within a program. Comparison operators return true or false and can be used with a conditional statement such as an if statement.

Logical operators: `&&` AND, `||` OR, `!` NOT. "AND" returns true if both expressions are true. OR returns true if eitehr expression is true. NOT returns true if the expression is false.

`if (expression) {`
`    statement1;`
`}`
`else {`
`    statement2;`
`}`

Executes statemetn1 if expression is true, otherwise executes expression2.
