>"a system must consist of three kinds of things: elements, interconnections and a function" 

<cite>"Thinking in Systems"</cite>, —Donella Meadows

A system is defined by three things: it’s components, their connections, and the function (or purpose), of the system. If a system loses its interconnections, or function, it ceases to be a system. It becomes just a collection of parts. It dies.

With the same wood, you can build a boat or barn. It doesn’t matter if it’s the highest quality wood on the planet; without the right connections and purpose, it’s just a mess of wood. The same can be said of human systems.

The article mentions “equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.” This is a measure of the interconnectedness of the system. If only one, or a few members, of the team are actively communicating, you’re not really leveraging the collective brain power of the team. A member’s “social sensitivity” facilitates their ability to interface with the team. An environment which has high “psychological safety” is an environment which high ease of interaction. The connects are stronger and respond more dynamically. You might think of it like strengthening the synapses between nerve cells. It makes the collection of people into a system of people.

Measures of social sensitivity, such as the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes” test, can be thought of as measuring the fidelity of a receiver. It symbolizes a clear connection. An environment with low psychological safety, perhaps due to low social sensitivity, can be thought of an an environment with a lot of systemic “noise” interfering with the transmission of information.

Goals can create a purpose, or function, for the human system. In Rozovsky’s related experiences, on important aspect in which the two differed was their goals. The competition team had clear shared goals, and were competing against other teams. The study team was their purely to achieve a credential, which in itself an invidually competitive goal (people get MBAs to give themselves a competitive edge in the hiring market).

Team leaders should facilitate the systematic nature of their teams. They can enable interaction by making goals clear, creating bonding opportunities, and tailoring their management style to that which most improves their team members’ sense of psychological safety.

Something that the article didn’t really go into is cultural competence. Measures like the “reading the eyes” depend on cultural context. A person will have an easier time “reading the eyes” of someone that grew up in their part of the world; because this sort of body language is shaped by the people you interact with (like spoken language). They are measuring a language-like form of communication. Cultures also vary in their communication style tendencies; such as, being high-context, indirect, and collectively oriented versus being low-context, direct, and individually oriented. However, being like a language, different styles can be learned (and quite quickly with immersion). Breadth of knowledge and perspective is the heart of innovation, and avoiding potential team members because of cultural differences is not only discriminatory, it could hurt innovation and productivity (in the long run; in the short term the requisite increase in adjustment period may temporarily reduce cohesiveness).
